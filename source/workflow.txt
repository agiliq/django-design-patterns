Use a source control system
-------------------------------
Use SVN, GIT, Hg whatever. But choose one and use it.

Use a bug tracking tool.
----------------------------
I recommend `Unfuddle <http://unfuddle.com/>`_, (It has various niceties, above a source control and bug tracking tool).
But others might work for you. In particular Trac is free.

Use a schema migration tool
------------------------------
There are various schema migration tools available. We use django-evolution, but
south is propbably more popular.

Create various entries in your /etc/hosts mapped to localhost
------------------------------------------------------------------
While development you probably want multiple users logged in to the site
simulataneously. For example, while developing, I have one user logged in the admin, one normal
user using the site. If both try to access the site from localhost, one will be
logged out when other logs in.

If you have multiple entries mapped to localhost in /etc/hosts, you can use
multiple users simulataneously logged in.

Do not commit the generated files
-----------------------------------
Django does not have a lot of auto generated files. However as you work with
other django apps, you may come across auto generated files. These should not be
checked in the the Django repository.
For example, for this book, we checkin the source files and folder, but not the
autogenerated build folders.
